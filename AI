The previous AI engineer’s work involved an intense, iterative cycle of feature development and critical bug fixing for the NEUROBOND application. Initially, core navigation and microphone functionalities were implemented and debugged, addressing ESLint errors and ensuring basic user interaction. A significant user request restructured the training flow from a chat-based model to a structured Scenario - - Evaluation format, which was further enhanced with detailed emotional scenarios and user avatar integration. Throughout, the engineer systematically addressed logical inconsistencies in training scenarios, including correcting the roles of participants. The most complex phase involved resolving recurring blank screen bugs in Dialog Coaching and Own Cases features, which stemmed from  scope issues and a backend f-string error, alongside critical dashboard navigation failures post-registration. The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer successfully resolving the registration/dashboard bug, declaring the application production ready.
