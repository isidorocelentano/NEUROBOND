The AI engineer focused on resolving critical UI/UX and authentication issues for the NEUROBOND application. Initially,  and  JavaScript errors in  were addressed by ensuring props were correctly passed from  and replacing  with . A recurring cursor jump problem in login and profile name input fields () consumed significant effort. Multiple iterations, including  and  with direct DOM manipulation and , were attempted. While temporary demo pages showed success, the issue persisted in the main application. A full authentication system (registration, login, password reset) was also implemented and tested, along with profile name update backend/frontend functionality. The last interaction reported the cursor jump issue persisting in the preview.

<product_requirements>
The NEUROBOND application is an AI-powered empathy training platform for couples, featuring a freemium model. A PRO subscription (CHF 10.00/month or CHF 100.00/year via Stripe) unlocks premium features like Dialog Coaching, Own Cases, Community Cases, and Partner Dashboard, with the Gef√ºhlslexikon having limited access for free users. Key features include 17 AI-powered training scenarios, a searchable emotion encyclopedia, 20 anonymized community cases, and a user dashboard. Recent development has focused on iOS optimizations, freemium model redesign with PRO access checks and UI locks, creation of PRO test access mechanisms, and significant improvements to the login flow. Furthermore, fixes for training scenarios (AI prompts), an attempt at bilingual support (reverted), resolution of a persistent login input field issue (multiple attempts), and deployment blockers (MongoDB auth, still pending) were undertaken. The latest focus includes fixing navigation errors in training scenarios, adding user and partner name input to profiles, and stabilizing these input fields.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was attempting to fix a persistent cursor jump issue in the profile name input fields, which was reported by the user after previous attempts at stabilization (using , , and direct DOM manipulation demos) failed to fully resolve the problem in the actual application preview.

The engineer's latest approach involved a radical solution, using an Ultra-Direct Pure DOM method within  (or related input components within App.js) to manage the input fields completely outside of React's state control, relying solely on direct browser events and DOM manipulation. This involved removing React State management for input values and using  to interact directly with the DOM element.

The engineer created a test page () to demonstrate this solution, which showed success in a controlled environment, confirming that the input fields could be stabilized. The goal was to eliminate the cursor jump problem permanently. However, despite these efforts and the successful demonstration on a standalone test page, the user reported that Der cursor jumps immer noch (The cursor still jumps) in the preview version of the main application, indicating the issue remains unresolved within the integrated frontend.
