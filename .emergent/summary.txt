The previous AI engineer initially focused on debugging the Stripe payment flow for the PRO Version starten feature. After persistent issues with a modal-based payment display (Chat Messages 275-345 in the original trajectory), the approach shifted to a dedicated  component. This new page successfully rendered, but upon clicking monthly/yearly payment options, the user reported a white screen (Chat Message 50). The engineer investigated  for the  implementation (Chat Message 11, 39-42), checking  configuration (Chat Message 15, 47) and  for the Stripe checkout endpoint (Chat Message 19-35). Error handling and logging were added to  (Chat Messages 43, 45). The current state is that the white screen persists, indicating a JavaScript error or a backend API issue with Stripe integration. The engineer concluded that a JavaScript error is crashing the app and plans to test the backend.

The NEUROBOND application aims to provide empathy training for couples using 17 AI-powered scenarios across five Training Stufen, offering AI feedback. Core features include a Gefühlslexikon, Dialog-Coaching, Wöchentliche Trainingspläne, Community Cases, and contact forms. It operates on a freemium model, with a PRO subscription available at CHF 10.00/month or CHF 100.00/year via Stripe, including Swiss VAT. Recent developments focused on a dark-themed partner dashboard, dynamic daily goals, improved navigation, and user avatar uploads. The AI engineer has established interactive training scenarios, resolved critical UI/UX issues, and implemented data persistence. The current Gefühlslexikon is expanded with detailed emotional categories and practical examples. Community Cases was developed into a feature with 20 core therapy questions and database integration. The Pro-Version upgrade now utilizes a dedicated  for Stripe transactions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was debugging the PRO Version starten flow. After facing persistent issues with a modal for payment options, the strategy was changed to use a dedicated  component, which successfully rendered. However, the user reported a white screen upon clicking the monatlich (monthly) or jährlich (yearly) payment options on this . This indicates a JavaScript error in the frontend or an issue with the Stripe checkout session creation API call. The engineer investigated  to locate the  component's button handlers (lines 1137-1162 and 1209-1235) and added error handling and logging to these sections. The  in  was confirmed, and the backend  endpoint in  was examined. The AI engineer's last explicit action was to check the accessibility of the  within , confirming it was defined at line 12. The user's latest feedback (Chat Message 50) re-confirmed the white screen issue, leading the AI to conclude it's a JavaScript error crashing the app, and the next step involves thoroughly testing the backend.
