# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

VERIFICATION: All 6/6 tests passed.

FINDINGS: ✅ BACKEND API FULLY FUNCTIONAL: /api/training/start-scenario endpoint working perfectly (6/6 tests passed, 100% success rate) ✅ AI INTEGRATION WORKING: EMERGENT_LLM_KEY properly configured, GPT-4o generating quality German responses (311-348 characters) for scenarios 1, 6, and 12 ✅ RESPONSE FORMAT CORRECT: All required fields present (session_id, scenario, partner_message, partner_name) with proper data types ✅ PARTNER MESSAGE GENERATION: AI successfully generating contextual German dialogue content, not using fallback messages ✅ BACKEND LOGS CLEAN: No errors in backend logs, all API calls successful (200 OK responses) ✅ MULTIPLE SCENARIOS TESTED: Basic (ID=1), intermediate (ID=6), and expert (ID=12) all working correctly ✅ DATABASE INTEGRATION: Training sessions properly stored in MongoDB with correct session metadata. CONCLUSION: 'Lade Dialog...' issue is NOT caused by backend API problems. The training scenario start endpoint is fully operational and generating proper dialogue content.

CONCLUSION: Training scenario individualization issue has been RESOLVED. Each scenario generates unique, contextually appropriate responses. AI integration working correctly with proper fallbacks. The reported issue of 'same responses' is no longer present in the backend system."

The /api/checkout/session endpoints for both monthly and yearly packages are working correctly, returning proper JSON responses with required 'url' and 'session_id' fields. Valid Stripe checkout URLs are generated successfully. Backend logs are clean with no errors. CONCLUSION: White screen issue is NOT caused by backend API problems. Root cause is in frontend - either payment button click handlers not triggering properly, modal display logic preventing upgrade modal from appearing, or JavaScript errors in browser. Next step is to test frontend payment flow to identify the exact frontend issue."
